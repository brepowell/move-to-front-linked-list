Directions:
Your writeup can be Word or PDF and should consist of the two program outputs and a brief (1 or 2 paragraph) interpretation of the results. This writeup should be at the top level of your repository for this assignment (please don't make me hunt for it). Of course, you should also have the code for your two class implementations. You likely will have other files in your repo to enable you to test your programs; I'll ignore anything other than the files for your two list classes and will link them to my own main() for testing.
